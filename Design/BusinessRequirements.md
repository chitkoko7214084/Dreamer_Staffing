# Business Requirements


<h2>Business Requirement 1: Online Application & Submission</h2>
  
Objective: To build a user-friendly, web-based system that allows applicants to submit their applications online and enables Dreamer Staffing to manage them efficiently.

1.1 Application Submission
The system must provide an online application form accessible to all applicants via a web browser.
The system must allow Dreamer Staffing staff to fill out and submit applications on behalf of applicants who lack computer access.

1.2 Application Content
The application must collect personal information (name, phone, email, address, etc.).
The application must include a section for the applicant's work history.
The application must collect information on skills and certifications (e.g., forklift, safety training).

1.3 Assessment Integration
The system must include a digital assessment test that applicants must complete as part of the application process.
The assessment will cover specific topics, including English proficiency and safety knowledge.

1.4 Applicant Management
The system must provide a secure portal for Dreamer Staffing staff to view and manage all submitted applications.
The portal must enable staff to search, sort, and filter applications based on various criteria (e.g., name, date, readiness score).

<h2>Business Requirement 2: Automated Applicant Scoring & Categorization</h2>

Objective: To create an automated system that calculates a readiness score and categorizes applicants, allowing staff to quickly identify qualified candidates.

2.1 Automatic Scoring
The system must automatically calculate a single, composite "Readiness Score" for each applicant upon application submission.
The Readiness Score will be a weighted average of three key factors:
Skills/Certifications: (e.g., forklift, safety training)
English Proficiency: Based on the results of the English skills test.
Safety Knowledge: Based on the results of the safety knowledge test.
The specific weighting of each factor will be defined in a separate document.

2.2 Readiness Categorization
The system must categorize each applicant into one of four readiness levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Not Ready).
The categorization will be based on the applicant's Readiness Score. The score ranges for each category will be predefined.
The categorization must be visually represented to the staff. For example, a color-coded system (e.g., Green for High, Yellow for Medium, Red for Low) should be implemented.

2.3 Staff Interface
The applicant management portal must prominently display the Readiness Score and the corresponding readiness category (with color-coding) for each applicant.
Staff must be able to filter applicants by their readiness category to easily focus on the most qualified candidates.
